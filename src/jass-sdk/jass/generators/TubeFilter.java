/** A filter corresponding to a tube of a given length and shape.
    Excitation enters one side ("glottis") and sound is produced at the other
    end. Besides shape data it needs the glottal reflection coefficient and
    the total damping factor, modeling losses in the system. This class offers
    also a higher level interface to set the tube parameters through the TubeShape.
