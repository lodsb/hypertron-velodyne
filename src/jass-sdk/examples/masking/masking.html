<p>
Generate two sine waves and white noise to experiment with masking.
Keep the first tone at decibel level 0 and at some fixed frequency. Then
see how soft the softest tone 2 needs to be to be just barely audible 
as a function of frequency. <p>

The  result  is called  the  masking  threshold,  and is  a  complicated
function of  the second  frequency, and also  of the absolute  level and
frequency of  tone 1. So  if you crank  up your speakers you  should get
different results! The result has provided audiologists deep insights in
the functioning of the ear. It is thought to originate in the non-linear
excitations of the  basilar membrane, a drum-like membrane  in the inner
ear which resonates  with sounds coming into your  ear. Different sounds
generate different  patterns in this  membrane. Sensors are  attached at
various places  to the  basilar membrane and  generate currents  when it
moves.   Those  currents  then  excite braincells,  which  excite  other
braincells, and eventually you'll  experience the sound of Bachs Cantata
106, fingernails  on a  blackboard, crickets in the night, etc.<p>

You can  also use  this applet to  measure noise-tone masking.   Set the
white noise to some intermeditate level  and see how loud a tone must be
to be just  audible. For frequencies around 440 Hz or  so this should be
at a  difference of about  17 dB for  most people. For higher  tones the
threshold is higher. Of course  your computer speakers and soundcard are
most likely  not calibrated, so  you'll get inaccurate results,  but you
can still get a feeling for the effect.<p>

The masking threshold data are widely used in audio compression such as
MPEG (mp3; NAPSTER!)  to remove tones we supposedly  can't hear anyways.
No point downloading stuff you can't hear anyways!<p>

Of course  there are always people  who claim to have  better taste than
others and they  complain that the sounds that  are eliminated are based
on the average population, whereas  they are much more disciminating and
can hear  stuff that the average  Joe never gave a  second thought. Some
people  believe these  are  "elitists", other  people  believe they  are
"right".
<p>
So try it for yourself...

/*
  Tones of the form:
  y = a*sin(2*pi*f*t)
  I(y) = a*a/2
  db = 10*log(a*a/(2*I0)) = 10*log(a*a/2) - 10*log(I0)

  noise of the form:
  y = a * rnd(t), rnd white noise of bandwidth Fb
  I(y) = a*a/3
  D(y) = I(y)/Fb
  Level l(y) = 10*log(a*a/(3*Fb*I0)) = 10*log(a*a/(3*Fb)) - 10*log(I0)

  A tone can be heard when its db level is 17 above the density level
  of white noise in these units.
  We've set I0 = 1, arbitrary.
