JASS  (Java Audio  Synthesis System)  is  a unit  generator based  audio
synthesis programming environment written in pure Java. Java 1.5 is
required.  The environment
is based on a foundation structure  consisting of a small number of Java
interfaces and  abstract classes, which implement the functionality
needed to create filter-graphs, or "patches".
Unit generators are created by extending the abstract classes and
implementing   a  single   method.  
Patches are created by  linking together unit generators in arbitrary
complex  graph structures.  Patches  can be  rendered in  real-time with
special unit generators that  communicate with the audio hardware, which
have been  implemented using the  JavaSound API and  through JNI
for some platforms. <p>

As  an  alternative  to   JavaSound,  low  latency  synthesis  has  been
implemented  through  native methods.  As  of  Java  1.5 most  javasound
implementations will  suffice.  This is currently  implemented for LINUX
(ALSA and  OSS), Macintosh (OS/X),  and Windows (DirectX,  ASIO blocking
API,  ASIO  callback  API).   All  native  implementations  except  ASIO
callback                              use                             <a
href="http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/~gary/rtaudio/">RtAudio</a>,        a
realtime audio i/o C++ class written by Gary P. Scavone.<p>

JASS with full source code  is freely available  for non commercial
use. If you find a bug, let <a href=mailto:kvdoel@cs.ubc.ca>me</a> know
what it is. Please include the release you were using from the <a
href=info.txt>
info.txt</a> file included with your release.<p>

The  JASS system  has been  used to  design algorithms  to automatically
generate  soundtracks  for  dynamics  simulations  with  contacts.   The
resulting system, FoleyAutomatic, is described in a SIGGRAPH 2001 paper:

The results are demonstrated with a

clip  </a> of real-time dynamical simulations  using  JASS to create the
sound-effects.<p>

<h4>Online Demos</h4>

Below are the  online Java Applets, with source code,  from the JASS SDK
demonstrating  various  real-time  audio  synthesis  algorithms.   These
Applets can be run from any  Java 5 enabled web browser such as Netscape
6 and up  (tested on  Windows and LINUX),  Internet  Explorer 6 and up
(tested  on  Windows) ,  or  Opera  5.11  (tested on  Windows). 
<p>

A few  demos below  use mike  input which may  or may  not work  in your
browser, depending  on your security  configuration which may or  may not
allow applets to listen to your mike input.
