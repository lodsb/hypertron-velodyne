RtAudio - a C++ class which provides a common API for realtime audio input/output across Linux (native ALSA and OSS), SGI, Macintosh OS X (CoreAudio), and Windows (DirectSound and ASIO) operating systems.

By Gary P. Scavone, 2002.

To configure and compile (on Unix systems):

1. Unpack the RtAudio distribution (tar -xzf rtaudio-2.x.tar.gz).
2. From within the directory containing this file, run configure:

   ./configure

3. From within the "tests" directory, type "make".

A few options can be passed to configure, including:

  --enable-debug = enable various debug output
  --with-alsa = choose native ALSA API support (linux only)

Typing "./configure --help" will display all the available options.

If you wish to use a different compiler than that selected by configure, specify that compiler in the command line (ex. to use CC):

  ./configure CXX=CC


For Windows Users:

Visual C++ 6.0 project files are included for the test programs.  For projects using the DirectSound API, go to the /tests/DirectSound/ directory.  For projects using the ASIO API, go to the /tests/asio/ directory.
